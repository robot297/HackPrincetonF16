# HackPrincetonF16

In the current media landscape, control over distribution has become almost as important as the actual creation of content, and that has given Facebook a huge amount of power. The impact that Facebook newsfeed has in the formation of opinions in the real world is so huge that it potentially affected the 2016 election decisions, however these newsfeed were not completely accurate. Our solution? FiB because with 1.5 Billion Users, Every Single Tweak in an Algorithm Can Make a Change, and we don't stop at just one.
